Find a random instance of an ActiveRecord model within an association.

For finding a single random instance, use find_one_random, which uses a SQL count query and offset to
efficiently return a single random instance.

  User.find_one_random


For larger sets of randomly-selected instances, use find_random with the number of instance you would like returned.
These instance are guaranteed to be unique within the returned set.

  User.find_random 2
